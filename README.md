# External libraries for *The Cave of Illusions*

This repository contains the external libraries needed to compile *The Cave of Illusions* on Windows using Visual Studio. This repository is not needed to compile the game on POSIX platforms (including Cygwin and MinGW); it is expected that these libraries are installed beforehand on these platforms.

The libraries included are:
- [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) (version 2.0.5)
- [SDL_ttf](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/) (version 2.0.14, compiled for SDL2) and dependencies

Please refer to the individual library folders for licensing details.
